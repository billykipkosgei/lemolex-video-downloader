# Migrating from Railway to Digital Ocean

This document explains why we've migrated the Lemolex Video Downloader from Railway to Digital Ocean and what benefits this provides.

## Why We Migrated

### Bot Detection Issues

Railway deployments were experiencing YouTube bot detection issues, causing video downloads to fail. This is because:

1. **Shared IP Addresses**: Railway uses shared IP addresses that may have been flagged by YouTube
2. **Ephemeral Infrastructure**: Railway's ephemeral nature means your application gets different IPs frequently
3. **Data Center Ranges**: YouTube may block entire ranges of IPs from known cloud providers

### Digital Ocean Advantages

Digital Ocean provides several key advantages for this application:

1. **Better IP Reputation**: Digital Ocean's IP addresses typically have better reputation with YouTube
2. **Persistent Infrastructure**: Your Droplet maintains the same IP address
3. **Full Control**: Complete control over the server environment and configurations
4. **Improved Success Rate**: Tests show significantly higher success rates for video downloads
5. **Cost-Effective**: Basic Droplet ($5-6/month) is sufficient for this application

## Successful Testing Results

We've tested the application on Digital Ocean and confirmed:

- ✅ Video downloads complete successfully
- ✅ Bot detection is bypassed effectively with the included cookies
- ✅ Postman tests work as expected
- ✅ Performance is stable and reliable

## Migration Steps

The complete step-by-step guide for deploying to Digital Ocean is available in the [VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md](VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md) file. This guide is designed to be easy to follow even if you're new to VPS deployments.

## Cookie Authentication

This version includes updated cookies from a test account that successfully bypass YouTube's bot detection. The cookies are located in the `/cookies/youtube_cookies.txt` file and should work out of the box without any changes needed.

## Support

If you encounter any issues during migration or deployment, please contact the developer for assistance.
